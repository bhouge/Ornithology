<p>
Control birds here.
A refinement of our last class exercise.
We randomly associate a file with each button when the page loads.
When the left button is turned on, it sets the pitch multiplier to 8.
When the right button is turned on, it sets the pitch multipleir to 1.
So you can control the pitch based on whichever button was turned on most recently.
